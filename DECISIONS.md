# DECISIONS.md

Honest record of every non-obvious choice and every deviation from the brief.
Milestone 0 decisions are in §1–§9; Phase 2 (API + honest ETAs + ghost identity join)
begins at §10.

## 1. Pre-existing scaffold was preserved, not overwritten (deviation from Deliverable 1)

When work started, `ghostbus/` already contained a **different, more advanced
scaffold**: a Fastify "voxel transit" API (`server/index.ts`, `feeds.ts`, `live.ts`,
`scene.ts`), a full hand-built React frontend under `web/`, shared types, i18n, and
a multi-city coverage engine — all created the same day. The brief assumed a
greenfield (`Project root (create it)`), and asked for `/web` to be "just a
`npm create vite` skeleton, untouched placeholder."

**Decision:** preserve the existing work and layer Milestone 0 in additively rather
than delete a hand-built app. Deleting is irreversible; the existing code is
clearly intended later-phase work (its `server/live.ts` even references a
`BLOCKERS.md` noting that live rendering "needs the static GTFS seed … loaded into
Postgres" — which is exactly what M0 delivers).

**Consequences / honest deviations:**
- `/web` is **not** an untouched Vite skeleton — it already holds a real React app.
- `/server` contains both the pre-existing `server/*.ts` and the new `server/src/*.ts`
  (db, tz, gtfs, seed_toronto, collect) plus `server/migrations/`.
- `package.json` was **merged** (existing fastify/react/three deps kept; the four M0
  runtime deps + two type packages added; `seed:toronto` repointed to the new seeder;
  `collect` added). The old `seed:toronto` pointed at a non-existent
  `server/scripts/seed.ts`, so nothing working was lost.
- `gtfs-realtime-bindings` left at the pre-existing `^1.1.1` (see TOOLKIT.md).

## 2. Dual DB driver: pg + PGlite (the approved deviation)

The spec assumed `DATABASE_URL` is always set. We added an embedded-Postgres local
fallback so the app runs with zero signup:

- `DATABASE_URL` set → `pg` Pool (production). A **real Neon Postgres (us-east-2)**
  was provisioned for this milestone, so **pg is the primary path** and all shipped
  proof metrics come from it.
- `DATABASE_URL` unset → `@electric-sql/pglite`, persisting to `ghostbus/.data/pglite`.

The same standard-Postgres SQL runs on both (`server/src/db.ts`). Honest trade-offs:
- PGlite is single-threaded WASM — large loads are slower and it has no network pool.
  This is one reason the seed windows the data (see §3).
- Neon free tier: the pool is capped small (`max: 4`) and `sslmode=require` is used as
  given. Batched multi-row INSERTs (1000 rows/statement) keep the network round-trips
  down; loads commit in 40k-row chunks rather than one giant transaction.
- The PGlite path stays in the codebase and is a first-class, tested fallback.

## 3. Seed windows to service active in the next N days (the granted latitude)

By default the seeder loads `trips`, `stop_times`, and `shapes` **only** for
`service_id`s active within the next `GHOSTBUS_SEED_WINDOW_DAYS` days (default **7**).
`routes`, `stops`, `calendar`, `calendar_dates`, and `cities` are always loaded in full.

- Rationale: TTC `stop_times.txt` is millions of rows. Windowing keeps this week's
  ETAs and ghost detection exact while making the load fast on both PGlite and Neon.
- Re-seeding refreshes the window (`seed:toronto` is truncate-and-reload per table).
- `GHOSTBUS_SEED_FULL=1` disables the filter and loads the entire feed.
- Honest downside: schedules beyond the window are not present until you re-seed. The
  collector only needs today's (and yesterday's, for after-midnight trips) schedule,
  which is always inside the window.

## 4. GTFS time storage

Times are stored as **seconds-past-service-midnight INTEGERs** (`arrival_s`,
`departure_s`), so a GTFS time like `25:30:00` becomes `91800` and stays valid for
trips that run past midnight. Parsing lives in `server/src/gtfs.ts::parseGtfsTime`.

## 5. `shapes.points` encoding

Stored as **JSONB**: an ordered array of `[lat, lon]` pairs sorted by
`shape_pt_sequence`. Chosen over a polyline string for zero-dependency
readback (`points[i][0]=lat`, `points[i][1]=lon`) by the future map layer.

## 6. Timezone / DST handling

All agency-local time math uses the built-in `Intl` API against IANA
`America/Toronto` (`server/src/tz.ts`) — no manual UTC offsets anywhere. `hour_of_week`
(0..167, Monday 00:00 = 0), service-day midnight epochs, and GTFS `>24:00:00` times are
all resolved through it, so EST/EDT and the DST transitions are handled by the tz
database, not by us.

## 7. Schema hardening adopted from review

- `stop_times` PRIMARY KEY `(agency, trip_id, stop_sequence)`; the redundant
  `(agency, trip_id)` index was dropped (the PK prefix covers it) to cut write cost on
  the multi-million-row load. Kept `(agency, stop_id, departure_s)`.
- `ghosts` PRIMARY KEY `(agency, trip_id, scheduled_start)`.
- `trip_delay_obs` gained a `service_date INTEGER` column and
  `UNIQUE (agency, trip_id, stop_id, service_date)` so idempotency is **DB-enforced**
  (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) rather than trusted only to the collector's in-memory
  dedupe (which is also kept, so restarts don't hammer the DB).

## 8. Delay observations — what counts as an honest observation

From the TripUpdates feed, a `trip_delay_obs` row is written only when:
- the stop has been **passed** (its `stop_sequence` is behind the vehicle's
  `current_stop_sequence`, or its predicted event time is already in the past), **and**
- the `StopTimeUpdate` carries an **explicit `delay`** (departure delay preferred, else
  arrival). We do **not** synthesize a delay from predicted-time-minus-static when only a
  time is present — that would be an assumption dressed up as a measurement.
- Delays with `|delay| > 24h` are dropped as bogus.
- `hour_of_week` is computed from the event time (Toronto-local); `service_date` comes
  from the feed's `trip.start_date` when present, else the observation's Toronto date.

## 9. Ghost detection is gated on a measured trip_id match rate

RT ghost detection only makes sense if realtime `trip_id`s line up with static
`trip_id`s. On the first cycle with real trip_ids the collector measures the match rate;
if it is below 50%, ghost/cancelled emission is **suppressed** (otherwise every scheduled
trip would look like a ghost) and the mismatch is reported. See BLOCKERS.md for the
empirical result on live TTC data. **Phase 2 replaces this gate** with the identity join
in §12 and a mass-ghost breaker.

# Phase 2 — Toronto API + honest ETAs + ghost identity join

## 10. Deletions executed (old "voxel transit" generation)

Per the Phase-2 cleanup mandate, the pre-existing old-generation server was removed
(the hand-built `web/` app is deliberately untouched — it is Phase 3's to salvage):

- **`server/scene.ts`** — deleted. Synthetic/derived demo scene; honestly labeled but has
  no future (the spec's Demo Mode must replay REAL recorded data, a later phase).
- **`server/feeds.ts`** — deleted. Vancouver/multi-city feed catalog; Tier 0 is Toronto-only.
- **`server/index.ts`** — deleted. Multi-city `/api/:city` API bound to the synthetic scene.
- **`server/live.ts`** — deleted. Its protobuf decode is superseded by the collector/poller.
- **`three` + `@types/three`** — removed from `package.json` (imported nowhere; dead).
- Old scripts `dev:server` (pointed at the deleted `server/index.ts`) removed; `dev` and
  `start` rewired to the new `server/src/server.ts`. `concurrently` is retained in devDeps
  (unused by the new `dev`, but a general dev tool Phase 3 may use for web+api together).
- **`shared/types.ts`** — contents replaced with the new API request/response contract
  (same file path, imported by Phase 3's web app). The old voxel/i18n types were dropped.

## 11. One deployable service: in-process poller (Deliverable 2)

The GTFS-realtime poll cycle + in-memory stores were extracted from the old monolithic
`collect.ts` into **`server/src/poller.ts`** (`createPoller(db)` → start/stop + getters).
`collect.ts` is now a thin standalone wrapper (same `npm run collect`, `GHOSTBUS_MAX_CYCLES`
intact). The API (`server/src/server.ts`) starts the same poller in-process, so `/api/vehicles`
and `/api/health` read live state from memory — one process, per spec. All Phase-1 honesty
guards are intact: feedsFresh gate, per-stop dedupe (+ DB unique), 14-day retention, vehicle
eviction, bogus-delay drop.

## 12. Identity join — DEVIATION from the literal `(route_id, start_date, start_time)` key

The spec's proposed join key could not be built as written because **the TTC RT feed
provides neither `start_time` nor `start_date`** — both are empty strings on every entity
(measured, all 1200 vehicles / 1876 trip updates). What the feed does carry, measured live:

- `route_id` — matches the static `route_id` (174/175 distinct present in `routes`).
- `stop_id` (per StopTimeUpdate) — ~60–70% present in static `stops` (partial namespace).
- an explicit `delay` and a predicted `time` per StopTimeUpdate.
- `trip_id` — RT-internal, does NOT match static (~0.1%, confirmed again).

So the join uses the only sound handle — the schedule itself. For each stop a trip update
covers, `scheduled_time_at_stop = predicted_time − delay` (delay is *defined* relative to the
static schedule), converted to seconds-past-service-midnight. A static trip is claimed when
several such `(route_id, stop_id, scheduled-second)` points agree (±75s, **≥2 stops**). This
is a strict generalization of the spec's `(route_id, start_time)` key (many stops, not just the
first) and is **exact by the GTFS definition of `delay`** when the RT feed and the loaded static
are the same board period. The pure claim logic lives in `server/src/join.ts` and is unit-tested
(exact / tolerance / double-claim / unmatched / wrap / ambiguous).

- **`minVotes = 2`** deliberately: a single coincidental stop-time alignment must not claim a
  trip (that would fabricate presence and hide real ghosts). One vote is noise; two agreeing
  stops on the same route is signal.
- The index is built over **all loaded static trips** (not just calendar-active), so the join
  operates against everything we have; ghost detection then intersects claims with the
  calendar-active, due set.

## 13. Measured live join rate = 0% right now — the honest reason (clock vs board offset)

The machine clock is **2026-07-24 (Fri)** but this TTC GTFS feed's calendar validity is
**2026-07-26 … 2026-09-05** — the schedule board begins two days in the *future*. Consequences,
all honest and all documented rather than papered over:

- **0 calendar-active service today** → 0 "due" trips → **ghosts = 0** (an honest 0: there is no
  scheduled service today in this feed, so nothing can be a no-show). The mass-ghost breaker
  never trips (0/0).
- The currently-running RT trips reference the *pre-Jul-26* board, which is not in our static
  data, so `predicted − delay` doesn't line up with the loaded Jul-26+ timetable within ±75s.
  With the ≥2-stop safety threshold the live join rate is **0.0%** (corroborated by an
  independent probe: 3.8% of trips get exactly one coincidental vote, 0% get two).

The mechanism is correct and proven by unit tests; when the clock falls inside the feed's board
period (Jul 26+), `predicted − delay` equals the loaded `departure_s` by definition and the join
becomes near-exact, activating genuine ghost detection. See BLOCKERS.md for the full addendum.

## 14. `mass-ghost` sanity breaker

If a cycle would flag ghosts for **> 30%** of that cycle's due trips, emission is suppressed and
logged loudly (a mass no-show is almost certainly a feed outage or our bug, not reality). This
sits alongside the retained global `feedsFresh` guard (never scan for ghosts on a stale feed).

## 15. Honest ETAs + evidence thresholds (Deliverable 1 arrivals)

Every departure carries an evidence object `{ n, windowDays, bucket }`. The estimate is
`scheduled + median historical delay`, band P25–P75, chosen by hard thresholds (`server/src/eta.ts`):
`(route, stop, hour_of_week)` needs **n ≥ 8** (`stop-hour`); else `(route, hour_of_week)` needs
**n ≥ 20** (`route-hour`); else the estimate is **null** with `bucket:'none'` (schedule-only).
A confident estimate is never returned without its evidence. The `(route, hour_of_week)` rollup
is a new table, **`agg_delay_route`** (migration `003_phase2.sql`).

- **Arrivals `?at=` parameter (default = now):** a truthful "what is scheduled at time T"
  affordance (many transit APIs have one). It computes real scheduled departures from real
  static data for the given instant; it does not synthesize anything. It also makes the endpoint
  demonstrable despite the clock/board offset above: querying `at = now + 7d` lands inside the
  feed's validity at the *same hour_of_week* as the freshest observations, so real Friday-afternoon
  departures show real evidence. `liveEtaMs` is only attached when `at` is within 10 min of now
  (a live prediction is meaningless against a different-time scheduled slot).

## 16. Aggregation computed in JS (percentiles), verified on the driver

`server/src/aggregate.ts` recomputes `agg_delay` and `agg_delay_route` over a trailing 14-day
window and runs on API boot + hourly (and via `npm run aggregate`). Percentiles use
`percentileCont` (matching Postgres `percentile_cont`, unit-tested) computed **in JS** so the
numbers are byte-identical on the pg and PGlite drivers. `percentile_cont` was verified present
(logged each run: `true` on pg); JS is still used for cross-driver determinism. Each table is
rebuilt atomically inside a transaction so a reader never sees a half-written aggregate.

## 17. API security / hygiene

`@fastify/helmet` (security headers; CSP disabled here so Phase 3's SPA can set its own),
`@fastify/cors` locked to same-origin + `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` dev origins, `@fastify/rate-limit`
120/min on all routes. Every param is validated (bbox parse + 3°/side cap, radius cap 3 km, q ≤ 64
chars, lat/lon ranges, windowMin cap). Errors are uniform JSON — no stack traces. Static `web/dist`
is served only if it exists (it doesn't yet — Phase 3), with a JSON 404 for `/api/*`. The API binds
`127.0.0.1:8799` by default. `/api/vehicles` sets `isGhost:false` on every vehicle (a present
vehicle cannot be a ghost; the field exists for the map layer's stable contract).

## 18. Ghost confirmation + retraction (post-review hardening)

A ghost is a promise the app makes; a never-reconciled false positive would break that promise, so
ghosts are now both *confirmed* and *retractable* (`poller.ts`):
- **Confirmation:** a due trip must be absent for **≥2 consecutive cycles** (`ghostMissStreak`) before
  a ghost row is written — a single missed poll (or a trip claimed one cycle late) never emits.
- **Retraction:** every ghost this process writes is tracked (`ghostInserted`); if that trip is later
  claimed while still inside the due window, the ghost row is **DELETEd** and the retraction counted
  and logged. Both maps are pruned when a trip leaves the due window, so neither grows unbounded.

## 19. Static context reload on rollover / every 6h (post-review hardening)

`calendar`, `tripStarts`/`staticTripIds`, and the join index were loaded once forever, so a re-seed or
GTFS board swap needed a restart. Now `maybeReloadStatic()` reloads them on **service-day rollover** or
every **6h**, in the background (index rebuild is heavy), one at a time. `loadStaticContext()` builds
fresh structures and swaps them in atomically (`tripStarts` is now a reassignable binding), clears the
active-service cache, and **logs the board coverage** (`min..max` calendar date) each load so a board
change is visible. `/api/health` exposes `boardCoverage`. The ghost scan is additionally skipped while a
reload is in flight (`staticReloading`) so it never runs with a new trip map against the old join index.

**Known limitation (accepted):** the *API read-path* caches (`api.ts` `calendar`/`calendarDates`/
`routeMeta`) are still loaded once at boot, so after a board re-seed `/api/stops/:id/arrivals` can serve
stale schedule/route metadata until the API process restarts. The poller hot-reloads; the read-path does
not yet. Out of this phase's scope (the mandate was the collector's staleness) and low-impact for Tier 0
where a re-seed is operator-driven, but flagged here for a later phase.

## 22. CANCELED trips are excluded from the ghost path (post-review fix)

A trip the feed explicitly CANCELED (and that we identified) is also absent, so without care it would
enter the ghost `confirmed` set; because the ghost insert runs before the cancelled insert and both use
`ON CONFLICT (agency, trip_id, scheduled_start) DO NOTHING`, the ghost row would win and the cancellation
would be dropped (inflating `ghostsThisWeek`, undercounting `cancelledThisWeek`). Fixed: a due trip in
`canceledStatic` is skipped in the confirmation loop and, if a ghost row was already written for it, that
row is retracted so the `kind='cancelled'` insert wins. Dormant on TTC today (0 identifiable CANCELED
entities) but correct for any feed where identification works.

## 20. Mass-ghost breaker is now per-route AND global (post-review hardening)

The global >30%-of-due breaker stays, plus a **per-route** breaker: if a route with **≥4 due trips**
would emit ghosts for >30% of them, that route is suppressed and logged. A board update touching only a
few routes would slip past a global-only breaker; the per-route breaker catches it.

## 21. Small post-review fixes

- **Same-event time+delay** (`poller.ts`): the join reconstruction reads `time` and `delay` from the
  *same* `StopTimeEvent` (departure preferred, else arrival) — never a departure time with an arrival
  delay, which would corrupt the reconstructed schedule second.
- **arrivals `dayList` sized to the window** (`api.ts`): was a fixed 3 days; now spans one day before
  through one day after `[at, at+window]`, so a large `windowMin` (up to the 4320-min cap) never
  silently truncates.
- **`at=` sanity floor** (`api.ts`): timestamps before 2020-01-01 or more than 30 days in the future
  are rejected with a 400.
- **`WINDOW_DAYS` single source** — exported from `aggregate.ts` and imported by `api.ts`, so the
  `windowDays` in every evidence object can never drift from the window aggregates are actually computed
  over.
- **CANCELED identification + 304 behavior** — see BLOCKERS.md (measured: 0 standard-CANCELED entities;
  feed never sends 304).
